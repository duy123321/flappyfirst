# flappyfirst

This is my Flappy Bird AI model. Trying a few different models to make my version of Flappy Bird Run Best. Run the Agent Files. Each house it's own model.

- agent.py is based off Patrick Loeber's Model for Snake but refactored for Flappy Bird

- agentQ.py is inspired from Anthony Li's model
